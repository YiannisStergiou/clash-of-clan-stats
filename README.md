# Clash of Clans - Player Stats Analysis with R

A quick and fun personal project where I dive into a dataset from a 'Clash of Clans' clan.
Using **R**, I cleaned the data, identified active players
and performed a descriptive statistical analysis on key metrics like **Player Level** and **War Stars**.

The goal was to practice my data analysis and visualization skills on a dataset I find interesting.
